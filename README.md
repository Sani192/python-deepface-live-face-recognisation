This project is used for face recognisation when you already set up faces in the faces folder. It will recognise the face and speak the name.
I have created this project using Python with deepface learning. I used the OpenCV library and Python text-to-speech3 (pyttsx3).

It will continuously speak the recognised person's name at every 3 seconds. If you want to stop the running app then press the 'q' and it will stop the app.
